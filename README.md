# **Next.js App Router Dashboard**

🚀 **Dashboard Application** built as part of the official [Next.js App Router Course](https://nextjs.org/learn). This project served as a hands-on learning experience to deepen my knowledge in **React**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript**.

## 🖥️ **About the Project**

It is my first public project on GitHub and marks a significant milestone in my journey as a Full-Stack Developer.

This is a dashboard application built to explore the capabilities of the Next.js App Router. The project demonstrates a modern approach to building web applications with features such as server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes. It includes a clean, responsive UI styled with TailwindCSS and leverages TypeScript for strong typing and maintainability.

The application is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), utilizing a PostgreSQL database hosted by [Neon](https://console.neon.tech), ensuring reliable and efficient data storage.
